## Technologies and key concepts

As an introduction to React, this project uses create-react-app to get up and running quickly. Key concepts and lessons learned include React's component-based building blocks methodology, JSX, props, state, unidirectional data flow, conditional rendering, event handling, controlled vs. uncontrolled components and more. Main struggles lie in thinking the React way and working with state to update and render components appropriately.
